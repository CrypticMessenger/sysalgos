# HyperLogLog Implementation in Golang

This repository contains an implementation of the HyperLogLog (HLL) algorithm in Golang. The HyperLogLog algorithm is a probabilistic data structure used for estimating the cardinality (the number of distinct elements) of large datasets with high accuracy and low memory usage.

## Next steps

- [ ] Implement HLL++ algorithm

## Overview

HyperLogLog is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to process large-scale data and require an efficient way to estimate the number of unique elements. This can be crucial in applications such as web analytics, network traffic monitoring, and large-scale database management.

## Features

- **Efficient Cardinality Estimation:** The algorithm provides a near-accurate count of distinct elements with minimal memory usage.
- **Probabilistic Data Structure:** Utilizes fixed-size memory, making it highly scalable for large datasets.
- **Golang Implementation:** Written in Golang for high performance and concurrency support.

## Real-Life Applications

### Web Analytics

In web analytics, HyperLogLog can be used to estimate the number of unique visitors to a website. Traditional methods would require storing every visitor's ID, leading to high memory consumption. HyperLogLog, however, can provide an accurate estimate using significantly less memory.

### Network Traffic Monitoring

Network administrators can use HyperLogLog to monitor network traffic and estimate the number of unique IP addresses accessing a network. This helps in identifying potential security threats and managing network resources effectively.

### Large-Scale Database Management

In databases, HyperLogLog can be employed to optimize query planning by estimating the number of unique values in a column. This assists in indexing strategies and performance tuning without scanning the entire dataset.

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use the HyperLogLog implementation:

```go
package main

import (
	"hyperloglog/pkg"
	"math/rand"
	"sync"
)

func generateRandomString(length int, rng *rand.Rand) string {
	charset := "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
	b := make([]byte, length)
	for i := range b {
		b[i] = charset[rng.Intn(len(charset))]
	}
	return string(b)
}

var wg sync.WaitGroup

func main() {
	seed := int64(37) // Change this seed value as needed
	source := rand.NewSource(seed)

	// Create a new random number generator using the source
	rng := rand.New(source)

	var estimator pkg.CardinalityEstimator = pkg.NewHyperLogLog(4)
	for i := 0; i < 1000000; i++ {
		// wg.Add(1)
		 func() {
			// defer wg.Done()
			// Generate a random string
			randomString := generateRandomString(10, rng)

			// Add the random string to the HyperLogLog
			estimator.AddString(randomString)
		}()
	}
	println(estimator.Cardinality())

}
```
